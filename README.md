# The Plumbers Guide to the Galaxy
> Implementing a CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub

GitHub makes it easy to collaborate on code, but its true power comes when used as the centerpiece of a modern deployment pipeline.
This class will start with an overview of the concepts behind continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), two cornerstones of good software development.
After that, we'll cover how to start incorporating these practices into your workflow, by using GitHub to integrate with best-of-breed 3rd party tools.
This class is designed for those with intermediate Git and GitHub knowledge, but limited hands-on experience implementing CI/CD practices.
